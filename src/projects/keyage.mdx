keyage is a service that stores age public keys.

it was originally intended for usage with MLKEM768-X25519 keys, as because it's essentially referencing two identities at once the public keys are extremely long, making sharing impractical.

to avoid linking an unnecessary amount of information to keys, fingerprints are used, roughly equivalent to `base32_lower(public_key)[:26]`. these fingerprints can be used to lookup keys, and can be shared in place of the raw key content.

it is also possible to set a username/handle for your key account, although key-handle relations are one-to-one. handles are significantly more memorable than fingerprints, but it is important to note that this may make it possible to figure out who the owner of your keys are.

while the API is now feature-complete, there is currently no frontend and the API is not yet live.
