keyage is a REST API written in rust that stores age public keys.

it was originally intended for usage with MLKEM768-X25519 keys, as because it's essentially referencing two identities at once the public keys are extremely long, making sharing impractical.



it support returning a variable amount of colors as well as saving stored colors for performance.
